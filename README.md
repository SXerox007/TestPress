Solution in Java and c++


1. Reverse Number

Given a number N, print reverse of number N.
Note: Do not print leading zeros in output.
For example N = 100
Reverse of N will be 1 not 001.
Input: Input contains a single integer N.
Output: Print reverse of integer N.
Constraints:
1<=N<=10000

2. Closest Gift

You are on your way to find the gifts. All the gifts lie in your path in a straight line at prime
numbers and your house is at 0.
Given your current position find the closest gift to your position, and calculate the distance
between your current position and gift and tell the distance.
Ex:
For input 0, the output is 2
For number = 11, the output should be 0
For number = 2000000000, the output should be 11 For number = 1800000001, the output
should be 10


3. Maximum Number

Given an array of numbers, arrange them in a way that yields the largest value. For example, if
the given numbers are {54, 546, 548, 60}, the arrangement 6054854654 gives the largest value.
Input:
First line contains an integer N , Next line contains N integers separated by space.
Output:
Print the maximum number that can be obtained by using given numbers.
Constraints:
1<=N<=1000
1<=Number<=1000000
